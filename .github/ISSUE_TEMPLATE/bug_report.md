**Bug Severity**  
* [ ] **1 = Minor problem** that does not affect total framework functionality (e.g., computation error in a POD, problem with logging output, or an issue on a single system  
* [ ] **2 = Major problem** that affects overall functionality, but that does not occur for all users (e.g., problems installing the framework with a specific Conda version, a framework option that causes one or more PODs to fail, or missing/incompatible Python modules).  
* [ ] **3 = Catastrophic problem** that occurs frequently for multiple users and/or on multiple systems (e.g.,framework consistently fails to install on multiple systems, or one or more PODs continuously fails after running successfully)
