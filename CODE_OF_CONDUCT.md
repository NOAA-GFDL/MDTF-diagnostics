## Code of Conduct

The Model Diagnostics Task Force framework team is dedicated to providing a respectful and inclusive community for everyone. We provide this code of conduct as part of this commitment, following similar standards for other community development projects, as cited in the references. We do not tolerate harassment or bullying of any community member in any form. This applies equally to all community members regardless of their title, seniority, background, gender, etc., in all forums managed by the MDTF framework team. This includes the mailing lists, our GitHub project space, slack workspaces, in-person events, and any other forums created by the project team. In addition, violations of this code outside these spaces may affect a person's ability to participate within them. As part of the code of conduct policy, we will provide below ground rules for all forums (e.g meetings) created by the project team, supporting project initiatives. 

## General code of conduct 

Our code of conduct policy for the project community members emphasizes on the following key ground rules:

1.  Respect everyone's opinion and privacy.
2.  Every opinion has value.
3.  Listen attentively to everyone's point of view.

Furthermore, our community members are expected to adhere to the following:

* **1. Be friendly, patient, and welcoming**.    
   We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports
   people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited
   to, members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, color,
   immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual
   orientation, gender identity and expression, age, physical appearance, family
   status, technological or professional choices, academic
   discipline, religion, mental ability, and physical ability.

* **2. Be considerate and respectful**.    
   Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn
   will depend on the work of others. Any decision you make will affect users
   and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when
   making decisions.    
   Remember that we're a growing community with diverse members, and that you may be
   communicating with someone with a different primary language or cultural
   background. Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is
   no excuse for poor behavior or poor manners.
   Do not insult or put down other community members. A community where people
   feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.    
   
   
* **3. Consider Impact vs. Intent**.    
   Disagreements, both social and
   technical, happen all the time and this project forum is no exception. 
   People perceive their own behaviors very differently than others perceive them. 
   What motivates one person may cause stress for another. 
   A few steps worth remembering include the following:

   * Other people do not see things the same way you do, 
   do not feel the same as you, or interpret the world the way you do. 
   Consider different people’s perspectives on things like change, 
   drive, structure, process, big picture, and small details.
   * Ask for and listen to feedback. 
   * Blaming each other doesn’t get us anywhere, while we can learn from mistakes to find better solutions. 

* **4. Moderate your expectations**.    
   Please respect that community members choose
   how they spend their time in the project. A thoughtful question about your
   expectations is preferable to demands for another person's time.

* **5. A simple apology can go a long way**.    
   It can often de-escalate a situation,
   and telling someone that you are sorry is an act of empathy that doesn’t
   automatically imply an admission of guilt.

* **6. Give due credit and avoid miscredit**.   

Motivate yourself and your community by acknowledging and giving credit to the original source, be it an individual-or-group, data-or-code, an inception of an idea, and so on, in different project forums. Discourage miscredit to foster a welcoming, inclusive environment.
We strive for the highest standards of scientific integrity. This includes sharing ideas and information, keeping accurate and complete records, and giving due credit to the contributions of others. Undisclosed conflicts of interest and scientific misconduct, including fabrication, falsification, and plagiarism, are incompatible with this code.


## Forms of harassment

We do not tolerate harassment or bullying of any community member in any form. 
Forms of harassment include, but is not limited to:

   * Violent threats or violent language directed against another person
   * Discriminatory jokes and language
   * Posting sexually explicit or violent material
   * Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally identifying
     information ("doxing")
   * Personal insults, especially those related to gender, 
   gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, ability, 
   physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, 
   religion, socioeconomic status, caste or creed
   * Unwelcome sexual attention or stalking
   * Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior
   * Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop,
     then stop
          

## How to Report Harassment and Discrimination

 If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, please report this in a timely manner. Code of conduct violations reduce the value of the community for everyone and we take them seriously.
You can file a report by filling out [this form](https://forms.gle/Mx4WqA6A1NZunj9A6). 
The online form gives you the option to keep your report anonymous or request that we follow up with you directly. While we cannot follow up on an anonymous report, we will take appropriate action.
Some forms of harassment and discrimination may rise to the level where they cannot be addressed within the MDTF team, and must be reported to the relevant home institution(s). Home institution regulations supersede these guidelines where there are differences. Harassment procedures at some institutions require reporting to Title IX officers under certain circumstances.
##  Review

This code of conduct document will be reviewed periodically on annual basis by the Model Diagnostics Task Force leads team members.
