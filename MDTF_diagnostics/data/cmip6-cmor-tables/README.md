# cmip6-cmor-tables

Note:
----
Only `CMOR` and `PrePARE` should use the `JSON` file of concatenated `CMIP6` Control Vocabulary [CMIP6_CV.json](https://github.com/PCMDI/cmip6-cmor-tables/blob/master/Tables/CMIP6_CV.json) found in this repository.  

All other software should get the CV's directly from the [WCRP](https://github.com/WCRP-CMIP/CMIP6_CVs) repository. 

CMIP6 Data Request can be found in the following [mip tables](http://clipc-services.ceda.ac.uk/dreq/index/miptable.html).
