Methods are provided in order to test some functionality of
this code without running the entire framework.

They are all accessed through blocking.csh, which sets env vars as if MDTF
were running the code. It can call blocking.ncl as if it was called by
MDTF. Note this is only useful after MDTF has written the pre-processed
model data into $WK_DIR/$PODNAME/$freq/$CASE.$VAR.$freq.nc
(eg $WK_DIR/blocking_neale/day/30L_cam5301_FAMIP.zg500.day.nc)
If this file is missing, set input flag (default_tests.jsonc):
  "save_nc": true,

blocking.csh can also call test.ncl, in which flags can be set to do
unit-type testing for some small pieces of code.
