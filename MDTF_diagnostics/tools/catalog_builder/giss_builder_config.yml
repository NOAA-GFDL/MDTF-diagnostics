## Configuration file template for catalog_builder
## DRS convention to use cmip | gfdl | cesm
convention: cmip
## IMPORTANT: Attempting to build a catalog of the entire contents of a pp directory will likely max out available PPAN resources (i.e., it takes longer than 12 hours to build a catalog for atmos/ts/monthly/5yr one node w/16 threads). It is strongly recommended to use include_patterns and/or exclude_patterns to target a specific subset of variables and dates to improve the performance of the catalog builder.
## Path(s) to the root directory with the target dataset
data_root_dirs:
  - /net/jml/mdtf/inputdata/model/GISS-E2-1-G_historical_r1i1p1f1_gn/3hr
 # - /archive/oar.gfdl.cmip6/ESM4/DECK/ESM4_historical_D1/gfdl.ncrc4-intel16-prod-openmp/pp/atmos/ts/monthly/5yr
## (optional) dataset id used to determine parser for selected convention. Accepted values: am5
# dataset_id: giss-E2
## depth to traverse for files from data_root_dir(s)
## (e.g., files that are in the root directory have dir_depth=1)
dir_depth: 1
## where to write catalog csv and json header files
output_dir: /net/jml/mdtf
## name of catalog (.csv and .json will be appended to catalog and header files)
output_filename: esm_catalog_GISS-E2-hist_r1i1p1f1_3hr
## number of threads: 16 (for job running on one analysis node)
## The example catalog for the UDA directory takes a little over 5 min to build
num_threads: 4
## optional list of patterns to include in file and directory search
#include_patterns:
#  - "*hght.nc"
#  - "*slp.nc"
#  - "*t_surf.nc"
#  - "*t_ref.nc"
## optional list of patterns to exclude from file and directory search
exclude_patterns:
  - "DO_NOT_USE"
