ENSO Rossby wave sources (ENSO_RWS) diagnostic package consists of four
levels. With a focus on identifying leading processes that determine
ENSO-induced global teleconnection, particularly the Pacific North
American (PNA) pattern, main module of the POD estimates basic state
flow properties at an appropriate tropospheric upper-level and solves
barotropic vorticity equation to estimate various terms that contribute
to the total anomalous RWS. In that pursuit, POD is applied to monthly
data (climate model or reanalysis products), and RWS terms are estimated
for “composite” El Niño or La Nina events. To attain robust “composite”
results a reasonable sample of ENSO winters is needed. However, the POD
can be applied even for a single El Niño winter (e.g., when applied to
seasonal prediction models). Similarly, the POD is applicable to any
number of pressure levels (e.g., to identify the level at which maximum
upper-level divergence and associated RWS are located). Here, reanalysis
products (e.g., ERA-interim) is “considered” as “observations” and
diagnostics obtained from ERA-Interim and other reanalysis products are
used for model validation. In this general document, brief descriptions
of the four levels of the POD are provided but detailed information is
provided at each level. For the four levels of diagnostics, selected
results are illustrated here.
