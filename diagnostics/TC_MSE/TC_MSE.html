<title>TC MSE Variance Budget</title>

    This POD reads in model track data to create 10 degree by 10 degree snapshots around a tropical cyclone (TC) center.
    The snapshots are made for all storms between the
    years inputted by the user and the column-integrated moist static energy (MSE) budget diabatic terms are calculated
    for in various ways (azimuthal mean, box-averaged normalized). Then, the snapshots are binned based on the maximum
    velocity at the time of the snapshot and composited by bin.  The bin composites are then compared across 5
    reanalysis datasets (CFSR, MERRA2, ERA-Interim, ERA-5, and JRA-55), which have already gone through the
    aforementioned procedure, by being plotted against each other in different ways shown below.
