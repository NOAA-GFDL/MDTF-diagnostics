<title>TC MSE Variance Budget</title>

<p>
This POD reads in model track data to create 10 degree by 10 degree snapshots around a tropical cyclone (TC) center. The snapshots are made for all storms between 
the years inputted by the user and the column-integrated moist static energy (MSE) budget diabatic terms are calculated for in various ways (azimuthal mean, box-averaged
nromalized). Then, the snapshots are binned based on the maximum velocity at the time of the snapshot and composited by bin.  The bin composites are then compared 
across 5 reanalysis datasets (CFSR, MERRA2, ERA-Interim, ERA-5, and JRA-55), which have already gone through the aforementioned procedure, by being plotted against
each other in different ways shown below.
