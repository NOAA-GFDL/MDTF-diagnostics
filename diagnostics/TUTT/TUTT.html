<h3>Tropical Upper-Troposheric Trough (TUTT) Diagnostics </h3>
<p>
Tropical upper-tropospheric troughs (TUTTs) are part of summertime stationary waves and 
provide a unified framework that can be used to better understand variability of tropical
cyclones (TCs) over different basins. Identifying deficiencies in representing TUTTs has 
important implications for the improved regional TC simulation in climate models. A better 
understanding of how TUTTs will change as climate warms also increases our confidence in 
future TC projection. This diagnostic package is used to evaluate 200-hPa TUTT area in 
both climate models and reanalysis datasets.
