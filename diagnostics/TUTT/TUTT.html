<h3>Top-Heaviness Metric Diagnostics </h3>
<p>
The vertical profiles of diabatic heating have important implications for large-scale dynamics, 
especially for the coupling between the large-scale atmospheric circulation and precipitation 
processes. We adopt an objective approach to examine the top-heaviness of vertical motion, which 
is closely related to the heating profiles and a commonly available model output variable. 
The diagnostic/metric can also be used to evaluate the top-heaviness of diabatic heating.
