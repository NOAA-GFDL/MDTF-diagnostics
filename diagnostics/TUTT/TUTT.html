<h3>Tropical Upper-Troposheric Trough (TUTT) Diagnostics </h3>
<p>
Tropical upper-tropospheric troughs (TUTTs) are part of summertime stationary waves and 
provide a unified framework that can be used to better understand tropical and extratropical
variabilities like tropical cyclones (TCs) over different basins. A better understanding of 
how TUTTs will change as climate warms also increases our confidence in future TC projection. 
This POD is used to evaluate 200-hPa TUTT area in both climate models and reanalysis datasets.
