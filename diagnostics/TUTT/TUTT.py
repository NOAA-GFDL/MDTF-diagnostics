# Tropical upper-tropospheric troughs (TUTTs) are part of summertime stationary waves and 
# provide a unified framework that can be used to better understand variability of tropical
# cyclones (TCs) over different basins.Identifying deficiencies in representing TUTTs has 
# important implications for the improved regional TC simulation in climate models. A better 
# understanding of how TUTTs will change as climate warms also increases our confidence in 
# future TC projection. This diagnostic package is used to evaluate 200-hPa TUTT area in 
# both climate models and reanalysis datasets.

# Functionality
#
# 1) Calculates geostrophic zonal winds (Ug) using 200-hPa geopotential height with a fixed Coriolis parameter at 15N.
# 2) Identifies positions of the circumglobal contour of the long-term seasonal-mean Ug. The value of Ug can be specified by the user, 
#    usually ranges from 1 to 2 m/s. The zonal-mean latitude of the circumglobal contour is chosen as the reference latitude.
# 3) The TUTT index is estimated from the area where the circumglobal contour of seasonal-mean Ug extends southward of the reference latitude.
# 4) Calculates TUTT strength and central location.
#

# ================================================================================
#
#    All scripts of this package can be found under: /diagnostics/TUTT/ 
#    & observational data under: /obs_data/TUTT/
#
#    3-D (time-lat-lon) 200 hPa geopotential height fields are required;
#
# Required programming language: Tested in the Python 3.7 envrionment;
# Required libraries: "netCDF4", "skimage", "numpy", "scipy", "shapely.geometry", "cartopy"
