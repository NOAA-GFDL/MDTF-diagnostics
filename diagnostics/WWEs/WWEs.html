<h3>Westerly wind events</h3>
<p>
Westerly wind events (WWEs) are anomalously strong, long lasting westerlies
that predominantly occur over the west Pacific Ocean. They are capable
of exciting oceanic Kelvin waves, which in turn warm the ocean surface
and deepen the thermocline as the wave propagates eastward. These
WWE-Kelvin wave interactions can therefore play an important role in
ENSO variability and it is important to understand the fidelity of
WWEs and Kelvin waves in earth system models relative to observations.
</p>
<p>
This POD identifies WWEs and their characterisitics across the Pacific
Ocean (120E-280E) using daily equatorially averaged (2.5S - 2.5N)
120-day highpass filtered zonal wind stress from TropFlux observation
and earth system models (ESMs). The WWE characteristics include
central longitude and date, zonal extent, duration, and integrated
wind work (IWW), which is the sum of all zonal wind stress within the
WWE time-longitude patch. The IWW indicates the WWE's total forcing to
the ocean. The methods for WWE identification are fully discussed in
Riley Dellaripa et al. (2024).
<p>
The results of the WWE identification are plotted below in
time-longitude space (i.e., Hovmollers). The shading is the anomalous
zonal wind stress and the black outlines indicate the WWEs. Each
Hovmoller represents one year in the obserations or ESM.
<p>
Also plotted is a 1D histogram of the likelihood of each 1 longitude
bin across the Pacific experiencing a WWE per day. The likelihood is
calculated as the total number of unique events at each 1 longitude
divided by the total number of days in each data set. The reciprocal
of the frequncy indicates the average return rate of a WWE per
longitude or the average number of days between WWEs at each
longitude.  
<p>
A complementary POD assesses the fidelity of oceanic
Kelvin waves in ESMs.
