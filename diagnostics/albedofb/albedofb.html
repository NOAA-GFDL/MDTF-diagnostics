<h3>Surface Albedo Feedback</h3>
<p>This POD calculates the top of atmosphere radiative impact of
surface albedo changes associated with Arctic sea ice loss under
global warming. Four quantities are calculated:</p>
<p><strong>Climatological surface albedo</strong>: the ratio of
upwelling to downwelling shortwave radiation at the surface expressed
as a %.</p>
<p><strong>Radiative sensitivity</strong>: the change in reflected
shortwave radiation at the top of the atmosphere (in W m<sup>
-2</sup>) per 0.01 increase in surface albedo. This quantity, akin to
a surface albedo radiative kernel, is calculated from the
climatological radiative fluxes at the top of atmosphere and surface
using a simplified shortwave radiation model. Higher values generally
correspond to less cloudy mean states.</p>
<p><strong>Ice sensitivity (also called surface sensitivity)</strong>: the change in surface albedo
normalized by the global mean surface temperature change. The observational quantity is 
the change in sea ice concentration times the
average albedo contrast between ocean and sea ice normalized by the global mean temperature change. </p>
<p><strong>Radiative impact of sea ice loss</strong>: the change in
top of atmosphere radiation (positive downward) due to changes in
surface albedo normalized by global mean surface temperature change,
in W m<sup>-2</sup> K<sup>-1</sup>. This quantity is equal to the
product of the <em>Radiative sensitivity</em> and <em>Ice
sensitivity</em>. The global and annual average of this quantity is
equal to the ice albedo feedback of the Arctic.</p>
<p>All calculated quantities are averages over the boreal summer,
defined as May, June, July and August. Change refers to the trend over the time period.</p>
