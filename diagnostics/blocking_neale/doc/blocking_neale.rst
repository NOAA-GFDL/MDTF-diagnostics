Rich Neale's Blocking Diagnostic Documentation
================================

Evaluate blocking frequency by season as determined by the meridional
gradient above a threshold value of daily 500mb height following
:ref:`D'Andrea et al (1998)<_ref-DAndrea>`
and a 2D variant of the above where lat and lon daily 500-mb thresholds are
considered :ref:`Davini et al<_ref-Davini>`

Functionality
-------------

Required programming language and libraries
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Python 3
- NCL (usual NCAR/CESM packages: contributed, gsn_code, gsn_csm


Required model output variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Geopotential height at 500 milibars or 3D field with air pressure available



Settings/Environment Variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
There are two sets of environment variables that can be set in the input
jsonc file:

1) What to compare input case(s) against: 
    - observational products from ERAI & MERRA. Can be turned on or off together. Default: On

    - three CESM 5-member ensembles (CAM3, CAM4, CAM5) which can be turned on or off individually. Default: CAM5 only. (Note that the code runs with these but the html file does not yet respond to this. Therefore the POD will fail to link the figures if non-default options are used)

	====================  ====================  
	  Variable name          Default  
	====================  ====================  
	MDTF_BLOCKING_OBS	True
	MDTF_BLOCKING_CAM3	False
	MDTF_BLOCKING_CAM4	False
	MDTF_BLOCKING_CAM5	True
	====================  ====================



2) Variables to control reading or writing of digested data 

   - ``MDTF_BLOCKING_READ_DIGESTED (Default True)``
    If True, the POD looks for digested data for the obs & CAM ensembles (MDTF_BLOCKING_READ_DIGESTED = False). 
    Digested means the data has been processed by this script into the `block_time` variable name and format.

    The POD is not currently capable of running with a mix of digested and undigested (other than the undigested MDTF input case). If the user desires this, it is recommended to run only the components that are not digested, and write out digested. Then re-running with MDTF_BLOCKING_READ_DIGESTED will work.

    It is not yet possible to run the MDTF input case with digested data, although it is possible to write it out

    OBS/CAM files are expected to be delineated with the file name & dir name as follows.
       |	 Digested:   obs_data/blocking/ERAI/ERAI.z500.day. *digested* .nc
       |	 Undigested: obs_data/blocking/*undigested*/ERAI/ERAI.z500.day.nc

   - ``MDTF_BLOCKING_WRITE_DIGESTED (Default False)``
    If True, whatever data was read in raw will be written out digested. This is how a user can make a new digested file, whether obs, a new case or ensemble, or a previous MDTF input case to compare against.

    
Code Overview
-------------
The POD is called by a python wrapper script, ``blocking_neale.py`` which
calls ``blocking.ncl``.

``blocking.ncl`` summary:

1. Read all case data from environmental variables and store it in ``all_cases`` structure

   ``all_cases = blocking_get_all_case_info()``
   is a data structure defined in blocking_funcs.ncl which
   contains arrays of length number of cases (mdtf case + obs cases + comparison models) and contains the following components:
    - ``case_names`` (short names; for ensembles these are the group name repeated length ncase)
    - ``file_names`` (paths to files for each case (distinct for each ensemble member))
    - ``var_names`` (what the variables are named in the datasets)
    - ``years_run0, years_run1`` (start and stop years for each case)
    - ``plot_colors`` hard-coded for consistency from run to run

2. Sets up figures that need to be done before each season is processed *To be done *

3. Loops over seasons (tested on ANN. DJF & JJA not tested)

   * Loops over files. File settings obtained by ``file_opts = extract_file_opts(all_cases,ifile)``

     1. If ``MDTF_BLOCKING_READ_DIGESTED = True`` 
       	* Calls ``blocking_digested.ncl:open_digested()`` to open 
	``file_opts@file_name`` (set in ``blocking_funcs.ncl:set_and_check_file_names()``)
	 reads  ``block_time = f_dig->$var_name$(idays,:)`` 
	 
	

	* ``else`` reads raw Z500 data using ``var_in_p = blocking_readfile_orig``
	and computes the blocking index as ``block_time(lon)``
	following :ref:`Tibaldi and Molteni (1990)<_ref-Tibaldi-Molteni>`

     2. If ``MDTF_BLOCKING_WRITE_DIGESTED`` Optionally writes ``block_time`` out as digested data 

     3. computes ``block_days`` as sum of all days that were blocked over the
         entire time period, as a function of longitude (as well as std for
         ensembles) ``block_std`` and ``block_freq`` to be blocked/all days. 

     4. for season ``ANN`` (annual) only, calculate daily frequencey
        ``block_freq_yr(ndoys,nlons)`` for Hovmüllers, 
	smoothed by `smth9_Wrap
        <https://www.ncl.ucar.edu/Document/Functions/Built-in/smth9.shtml>`__

   * Loops over ensemble groups for figures

     1. Store data in arrays ``block_freq_aves_p, block_freq_min_p/max_p`` 

     2. Set more plotting resources ``res_m``

     3. Individual (Hovmueller figures) 
       ``plot_t(ifile) = gsn_csm_hov(wks_ens_page, lonPivot(block_freq_yr,270.), res_t)``

     4. Combined seasonal figure (one figure with a line for each dataset)
        ``plot(ip) = gsn_csm_xy (wks,block_freq_aves_p&lon,block_freq_aves_p,res_m)``
