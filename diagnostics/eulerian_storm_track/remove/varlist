# - time-frequency: mon (monthly), day, 6hr, 3hr, 1hr
# - requirement = blank  (default = optional)                                          
#                      required (package cannot run without this)                           
#                      required unless field_name field_name2 ...

#   nb. if a variable is required at multiple time frequencies,
#       list it separately for each one
#
#          Clearly the developer can just leave out optional files
#          However, it is always nice to get an upfront warning of missing files
