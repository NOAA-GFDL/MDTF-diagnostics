<!-- 
    This file is the HTML output template for the example diagnostic and shows
    how you should describe and link to the plots your diagnostic generates.
    The framework will "fill in the blanks" corresponding to environment
    variables and copy the file to <WK_DIR>.
        
    EPS or PS files saved by your diagnostic are converted by the framework into
    bitmaps in the following locations:
    <WK_DIR>/model/PS/<plot_name>.eps -> <WK_DIR>/model/<plot_name>.png
    <WK_DIR>/obs/PS/<plot_name>.eps -> <WK_DIR>/obs/<plot_name>.png
    so the target of each link only needs to be the relative path, 
    eg. "model/<plot_name>.png".

<h3>Example diagnostic: time-averaged near-surface temperature</h3>
<p>
If this were a real diagnostic, this would be where you'd give a brief summary
of what your diagnostic computes and how to interpret the output plots it 
generated, which will be linked below. You can include hyperlinks to journal 
articles, etc. for more detailed documentation on your methods or sources of 
observational data.
</p>
<p>
The names of any environment variables set for the diagnostic (enclosed in 
curly braces) will be replaced by the same values they had when the diagnostic 
was run. For example, this diagnostic's favorite color is "{{EXAMPLE_FAV_COLOR}}."
