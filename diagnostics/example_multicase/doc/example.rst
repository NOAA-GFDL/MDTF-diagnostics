Multi-Case Example Diagnostic Documentation
================================

Last update: Feb-2022

This POD illustrates how multiple cases (experiments) can be analyzed together. The
muliple cases are specified to the MDTF Framework where they are initialized and
preprocessed independently. The framework then passes off a dictionary metadata
information for each case that can then be used byt the POD.

.. note::
  This POD assumes familiarity with the single-case example diagnostic

Functionality
-------------

In this example POD, near-surface air temperature is read from multiple cases. The
POD time averages the data and calculates the anomaly relative to the global mean.
The anomalies are zonally-averaged and the results from all cases are shown
on a single plot.

Required programming language and libraries
-------------------------------------------

* Python >= 3.7
* xarray
* matplotlib

Required model output variables
-------------------------------

* tas - Surface (2-m) air temperature (CF: air_temperature)
