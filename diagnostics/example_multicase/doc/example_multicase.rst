Multi-Case Example Diagnostic Documentation
================================

Last update: Oct 2022

This POD illustrates how multiple cases (experiments) can be analyzed together. The
muliple cases are specified to the MDTF Framework where they are initialized and
preprocessed independently.

.. note::
  This POD assumes familiarity with the single-case example diagnostic

Functionality
-------------
The framework generates yaml file called *case_info.yml* with environment variables
for the file paths and variable information for each case. The **example_multicase** POD reads the yaml file
information into a dictionary, and loops through the dictionary to read near-surface air temperature (TAS) data
for each case. The POD time averages the data and calculates the anomaly relative to the global mean.
The anomalies are zonally-averaged and the results from all cases are shown on a single plot.

Required programming language and libraries
-------------------------------------------

* Python >= 3.7
* xarray
* numpy
* matplotlib
* yaml
* sys

Required model output variables
-------------------------------

* tas - Surface (2-m) air temperature (CF: air_temperature)
