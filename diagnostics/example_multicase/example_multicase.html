<h3>Multi-Case Example Diagnostic: zonal-average near-surface temperature anomaly</h3>
<p>
    This POD illustrates how multiple cases (experiments) can be analyzed together.
    The MDTF-diagnostics framework initializes and processes each case, writes the environment variables for the cases
    to a yaml file (case_info.yml), and exports an ESM Intake catalog with information about the post-processed
    data for each ease to the working directory (WORK_DIR). The example_multicase POD driver script reads
    environment information from case_info.yml into a dictionary that it references to read data from the
    post-processed files in the data catalog.
</p>
<p>
    The example_multicase POD reads near-surface air temperature (TAS) from netcdf output files for multiple cases.
    The POD time averages the TAS data and calculates the anomaly relative to the global mean.
    The anomalies are zonally-averaged and the results from all cases are shown on a single plot.
