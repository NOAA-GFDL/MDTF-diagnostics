<h3>Multi-Case Example Diagnostic: zonal-average near-surface temperature anomaly</h3>
<p>
    This POD illustrates how multiple cases (experiments) can be analyzed together.
    The framework initializes and processes each case, writes the environment variables for the cases
    to a yaml file (case_info.yaml). The example_multicase POD reads information from the yaml file
    into a dictionary that it references to ingest data from the output files for each ease.
</p>
<p>
    The example_multicase POD reads near-surface air temperature (TAS) from netcdf output files for multiple cases.
    The POD time averages the TAS data and calculates the anomaly relative to the global mean.
    The anomalies are zonally-averaged and the results from all cases are shown on a single plot.
