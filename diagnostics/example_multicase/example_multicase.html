<h3>Multi-case Example diagnostic: zonal-average near-surface temperature anomaly</h3>
<p>
    This POD illustrates how multiple cases (experiments) can be analyzed together. The
    muliple cases are specified to the MDTF Framework where they are initialized and
    preprocessed independently. The framework then passes off a dictionary metadata
    information for each case that can then be used byt the POD.
</p>
<p>
    In this example POD, near-surface air temperature is read from multiple cases. The
    POD time averages the data and calculates the anomaly relative to the global mean.
    The anomalies are zonally-averaged and the results from all cases are shown
    on a single plot.
