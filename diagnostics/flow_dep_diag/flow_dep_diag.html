<h3>Flow-Dependent, Cross-Timescale Model Diagnostics </h3>
<p>
The flow-dependent model diagnostics compares daily atmospheric circulation pattern,
or weather types, characteristics in reanalyses and models to analyze misrepresented
physical processes related to spatiotemporal systematic errors in those models.
Relationships between these biases and climate teleconnections
(e.g., SST patterns, ENSO, MJO, etc.) can be explored in different models.
</p>
<p>
The names of any environment variables set for the diagnostic (enclosed in
curly braces) will be replaced by the same values they had when the diagnostic
was run. For example, this diagnostic's favorite color is "{EXAMPLE_FAV_COLOR}."
