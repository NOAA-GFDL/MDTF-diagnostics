<!-- 
    This file is the HTML output template for the example diagnostic and shows
    how you should describe and link to the plots your diagnostic generates.
    The framework will "fill in the blanks" corresponding to environment
    variables and copy the file to <WK_DIR>.
        
    EPS or PS files saved by your diagnostic are converted by the framework into
    bitmaps in the following locations:
    <WK_DIR>/model/PS/<plot_name>.eps -> <WK_DIR>/model/<plot_name>.png
    <WK_DIR>/obs/PS/<plot_name>.eps -> <WK_DIR>/obs/<plot_name>.png
    so the target of each link only needs to be the relative path, 
    eg. "model/<plot_name>.png".

<h3>Mixed Layer Depth</h3>
<p>This POD computes mixed layer depth from CMIP6 monthly temperature and salinity. Mixed layer depth computed from the EN4 reanalysis temperature and salinity is included to compare with models.</p>

<p>These figures show the mixed layer depth climatology for each month. Note that the colorbar varies between subplots. Users may wish to modify this.</p>

<p>The results from this POD are to be appear in a paper being prepared for the MAPP team special issue.</p>
