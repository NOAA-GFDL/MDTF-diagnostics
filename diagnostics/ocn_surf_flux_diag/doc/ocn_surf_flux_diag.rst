Ocean Surface Latent Heat Flux Diagnostic Documentation 
=======================================================

Last update: 12/10/2021

Tropical intra-seasonal (20-100 day) convection regulates weather patterns 
globally through extratropical teleconnections. Surface latent heat fluxes 
help maintain tropical intra-seasonal convection and the Madden-Julian 
oscillation by replenishing column water vapor lost to precipitation. 
Latent heat fluxes estimated using surface meteorology from moorings or 
satellites and the COARE3.0 bulk flux algorithm suggest that latent heat 
fluxes contribute about 8% of the intra-seasonal precipitation anomaly over 
the Indian and western tropical Pacific Oceans [Dellaripa and Maloney, 2015, 
Bui et al., 2020].

For this diagnostic, we use in-situ data from TAO/TRITON/RAMA to create a location-based latent 
heat flux matrix determined by specific humidity deficiency at the surface layer 
(dq) and surface wind speed (sfcWind). By comparing the matrix between observation 
and models/reanalysis, the diagnostic can help revealing where model/reanalysis latent heat flux biases are 
in the dq-sfcWind space. The latent heat flux biases shown in the diagnostic  
demonstrate dependence on both sfcWind and dq. An offline latent heat bias correction
can be performed on simulations based on the bias latent heat fluxes matrix 
as a function of dq and sfcWind.

Functionality
-------------

The main script generates the Latent heat flux matrix and bias matrix.

Python function used
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- groupby_variables.bin_2d : The function is written to bin the variable (target_var) in a xr.Dataset
                             based on two other variables (bin1_var, bin2_var) in the same xr.Dataset. 
                             The function calculate the mean, std, and count values of the target_var 
                             after binning.
                             
- model_read.regional_var  : The function is written to read the model output and required varaibles.
                             The function also crop the data based on the user set time period and 
                             region. Two varibales is calculated in this function 1) saturation specific  
                             humidity near surface (determined by surface temperature and surface pressure)
                             and 2) dq which represent the vertical difference of specific humidity

More about this diagnostic
--------------------------

Surface latent heat flux from ocean to the atmosphere is one of the important 
processes that provides water vapor and energy to the daily tropical rainfall. 
A visually intuitive latent heat flux diagnostic is proposed to better understand 
the model shortfall on its latent heat flux representation. This diagnostic allows 
a simple assessment of model latent heat flux biases arising either from biases in 
water vapor or surface wind speed as well as other empirical coefficients in the model. 
Sample POD result shows that, compared to ''observed'' fluxes also estimated from 
water vapor and surface wind speed measured at tropical moorings, tropical latent heat 
fluxes in the NCAR CEMS2 models are significantly overestimated when extreme water vapor 
or surface wind speed happens.
