<!-- 
    This file is the HTML output template for the example diagnostic and shows
    how you should describe and link to the plots your diagnostic generates.
    The framework will "fill in the blanks" corresponding to environment
    variables and copy the file to <WK_DIR>.
        
    EPS or PS files saved by your diagnostic are converted by the framework into
    bitmaps in the following locations:
    <WK_DIR>/model/PS/<plot_name>.eps -> <WK_DIR>/model/<plot_name>.png
    <WK_DIR>/obs/PS/<plot_name>.eps -> <WK_DIR>/obs/<plot_name>.png
    so the target of each link only needs to be the relative path, 
    eg. "model/<plot_name>.png".

<h3>Example diagnostic: ocean surface flux diagnostic </h3>
<p>
The example plot shows the latent heat flux diagnostic based on
observational dataset (left) from the TAO/TRITON and RAMA arrays. 
The latent heat flux values are binned based on the corresponding 
surface 10m wind speed (x direction) and moisture disequilibirum of specific humidity at the surface
(y direction). The white contour shows the 1% data points of all available points.
The latent heat flux diagnostic based on model is shown in the middle.
The right panel shows the difference between the model and observational data. The hatched area 
shows the difference between model and observation are statistically significant with 
99% confidence. The yellow and green contours show the 5 mm/day and 10 mm/day values associated with the 
surface wind speed and moisture disequilibrium values.
