Precipitation Buoyancy Diagnostic Package
========================================

The precipitation-buoyancy diagnostics POD is used to assess the thermodynamic sensitivity of model precipitation fields. 

Scientific basis
----------------------
Observations show that over tropical oceans, a lower tropospheric buoyancy metric :math:`B_L` has a strong relationship to precipitation ( :ref:`Ahmed and Neelin 2018 <ref-AN18>`, :ref:`Ahmed et al. 2020 <ref-AAN>`). This buoyancy metric can further be decomposed into two components:

1. A measure of undilute buoyancy termed CAPE :subscript:`L`, which measures the difference between boundary layer moist enthalpy and the free-tropospheric temperature. If convection were non-entraining, this would be the dominant thermodynamic measure affecting precipitation. 
2. A measure of lower-free tropospheric sub-saturation SUBSAT :subscript:`L`, which is computed as a departure from saturation in the lower free-troposphere. The influence of entrainment on convection is expressed through this measure.

In observations (ERA re-analysis and TRMM precipitation), precipitation appears to about equally sensitive to CAPE :subscript:`L` and SUBSAT :subscript:`L`. However, climate models can show diverging behavior. To measure this relative sensitivity of precipitation to CAPE :subscript:`L` and SUBSAT :subscript:`L`, a vector :math:`\gamma_{CS}` is introduced. This has a direction that is expressed in degrees and takes values ranging from 0 to 90.
