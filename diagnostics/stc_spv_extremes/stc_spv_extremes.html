<title>Stratosphere-Troposphere Coupling: Stratospheric Polar Vortex Extremes</title>
<img src="../mdtf_diag_banner.png">
<h3>Relationship of extreme stratospheric events to tropospheric and surface conditions</h3>
<p>
This POD assesses stratospheric polar vortex extremes, and the tropospheric circulation
and surface patterns that precede and follow them. Extremes in the 
stratospheric polar vortex are closely linked to the tropospheric
circulation and surface climate both before and after the event. The occurrence of 
polar stratospheric circulation extremes in the Northern Hemisphere (NH), such
as sudden stratospheric warmings (SSWs) and polar vortex intensifications (VIs), are important
aspects of stratospheric variability that rely on realistic representations of the 
stratosphere and the troposphere. Extremes in the strength of the Arctic polar 
stratospheric circulation are often preceded by known near-surface circulation 
patterns, and then subsequently followed by shifts in weather patterns (sometimes
for weeks). SSWs in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) are rare (only one event in the 
satellite record), while VIs occur more often, but both events can have persistent 
impacts on SH mid-latitude weather.
</p>

<p> The definition for SSW events used in this POD is the most commonly used one
(Charlon and Polvani 2007): a reversal of the 10 hPa 60 deg latitude daily-mean climatological
westerly zonal winds between November and March, which returns to westerly for at least 10
consecutive days prior to 30 April (so that final warmings are not included). SSWs are
independent events if they are separated by at least 20 days of consecutive westerlies.
The definition for VI events used in this POD is adapted from previous studies 
(Limpasuvan et al. 2005, Domeisen et al. 2020): an increase of the 10 hPa 60 deg latitude
daily-mean zonal-mean zonal winds above the daily 80th percentile value calculated across
the full input data time period, which persists for at least 10 consecutive days. VIs are
independent events if they are separated by at least 20 consecutive days below the 80th 
percentile. </p>

<p>Models often show a different SSW seasonality compared to reanalysis (Ayarzaguena et al. 2020),
and may vary in their simulation of tropospheric circulation/surface patterns 
both preceding and following extreme stratospheric events (Ayarzaguena et al. 2020). 
Models with low model lids (>1 hPa in pressure) may show less persistent 
downward coupling than models with higher model lids (Charlton-Perez et al. 2013).
SSWs and their precursor patterns and impacts have been heavily studied 
(Baldwin et al. 2021), but VIs less so (Limpasuvan et al. 2005). </p>

<p>
This POD uses daily-mean zonal-mean zonal mean winds, zonal-mean geopotential heights,
gridded geopotential heights at 500 hPa, and gridded surface air temperature.
