Top-Heaviness Metric Diagnostic Documentation
================================

Last update: 5/21/2021

The vertical profiles of diabatic heating have important implications for large-scale dynamics, especially for the coupling between the large-scale atmospheric circulation and precipitation processes. We adopt an objective approach to examine the top-heaviness of vertical motion (Back et al. 2017), which is closely related to the heating profiles and a commonly available model output variable. The diagnostic metric can also be used to evaluate the diabatic heating profile.

Functionality
-------------

The currently package consists of following functionalities:

(1) Calculation of percentage of variance explained by two base functions (idealized deep convection profile, idealized deep stratiform profile)

(2) Calculation of top-heaviness ratio (O2/O1)

(3) Other analysis (to be added soon)

(**) cropping.py can be referenced if code is needed to either shift the grid of your data
or to crop your data to a specified region

As a module of the MDTF code package, all scripts of this package can be found under
``mdtf/MDTF_$ver/diagnostics/top_heaviness_ratio``

Required programming language and libraries
-------------------------------------------

Python3 packages: "netCDF4", "xarray", "numpy", "scipy", "matplotlib", "basemap"

Required model output variables
-------------------------------

Monthly three spatial dimension Omega (units: Pa/s)

--------------------------

Q1 and Q2 (Figure 1) are two prescribed base functions. Q1 is characterized by idealized deep convection profile and Q2 is characterized by idealized deep stratiform profile. The concept of percentage of explained variance is similar to that of EOF analysis where we can regard Q1 and Q2 as two leading EOFs. Through such approximation, figure 2 reveals that using these two base functions can help tp explain most of the tropical and subtropical ocean. Top-heaviness ratio in figure 3 shows that the WP is characterized by more top-heavy circulation while EP and ATL are described by more bottom-heavy circulation. 

The top-heaviness is a useful tool to diagnose the coupling between diabatic process and large-scale circulation. If the model is not able to reproduce correct pattern of top-heaviness ratio, this would imply potential deficiencies in deep convection and stratiform scheme. In the future POD develop, we are considering adding shallow convection as a third base function. By doing so will enable us to further investigate the bias source of tropical and subtropical predicability.
