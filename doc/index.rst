Development of this code framework for process-oriented diagnostics was supported by the `National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration <https://www.noaa.gov/>`__ (NOAA) Climate Program Office `Modeling, Analysis, Predictions and Projections <https://cpo.noaa.gov/Meet-the-Divisions/Earth-System-Science-and-Modeling/MAPP>`__ (MAPP) Program (grant # NA18OAR4310280). Additional support was provided by `University of California Los Angeles <https://www.ucla.edu/>`__, the `Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory <https://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/>`__, the `National Center for Atmospheric Research <https://ncar.ucar.edu/>`__, `Colorado State University <https://www.colostate.edu/>`__, `Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory <https://www.llnl.gov/>`__ and the US `Department of Energy <https://www.energy.gov/>`__.

Many of the process-oriented diagnostics modules (PODs) were contributed by members of the NOAA `Model Diagnostics Task Force <https://cpo.noaa.gov/Meet-the-Divisions/Earth-System-Science-and-Modeling/MAPP/MAPP-Task-Forces/Model-Diagnostics-Task-Force>`__ under MAPP support.
