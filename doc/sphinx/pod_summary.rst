Summary of MDTF process-oriented diagnostics
============================================

The MDTF diagnostics package is a portable framework for running process-oriented diagnostics (PODs) on climate model data. Each POD script targets a specific physical process or emergent behavior, with the goals of determining how accurately the model represents that process, ensuring that models produce the right answers for the right reasons, and identifying gaps in the understanding of phenomena.

The scientific motivation and content behind the framework was described in E. D. Maloney et al. (2019): Process-Oriented Evaluation of Climate and Weather Forecasting Models. *BAMS*, **100** (9), 1665–1686, `doi:10.1175/BAMS-D-18-0042.1 <https://doi.org/10.1175/BAMS-D-18-0042.1>`__.

Convective Transition Diagnostics
---------------------------------

*J. David Neelin (UCLA)*
neelin@atmos.ucla.edu

This POD computes statistics that relate precipitation to measures of tropospheric temperature and moisture, as an evaluation of the interaction of parameterized convective processes with the large-scale environment. Here the basic statistics include the conditional average and probability of precipitation, PDF of column water vapor (CWV) for all events and precipitating events, evaluated over tropical oceans. The critical values at which the conditionally averaged precipitation sharply increases as CWV exceeds the critical threshold are also computed (provided the model exhibits such an increase).

==================  ==================
Variables           Frequency
==================  ==================
Precipitation rate  6-hourly or higher
Column water vapor  6-hourly or higher
==================  ==================

Extratropical Variance (EOF 500hPa Height)
------------------------------------------

*CESM/AMWG (NCAR)*

MJO Propagation and Amplitude
-----------------------------

*Xianan Jiang (UCLA)*

This POD calculates the model skill scores of MJO eastward propagation versus winter mean low-level moisture pattern over Indo-Pacific, and compares the simulated amplitude of MJO over the Indian Ocean versus moisture convective adjustment time-scale.

MJO Spectra and Phasing
-----------------------

*CESM/AMWG (NCAR)*
bundy@ucar.edu

This PDO computes many of the diagnostics described by the WGNE MJO Task Force and developed by Dennis Shea for observational data. Using daily precipitation, outgoing longwave radiation, zonal wind at 850 and 200 hPa and meridional wind at 200 hPa, the module computes anomalies, bandpass-filters for the 20-100 day period, calculates the MJO Index as defined as the running variance over the bandpass filtered data, performs an EOF analysis, and calculates lag cross-correlations, wave-number frequency spectra and composite life cycles of MJO events.

MJO Teleconnections 
-------------------

*Eric Maloney (CSU)*
eric.maloney@colosate.edu

The POD first compares MJO phase (1-8) composites of anomalous 250 hPa geopotential height and precipitation with observations (ERA-Interim/GPCP) and several CMIP5 models (BCC-CSM1.1, CNRM-CM5, GFDL-CM3, MIROC5, MRI-CGCM3, and NorESM1-M). Then, average teleconnection performance across all MJO phases defined using a pattern correlation of geopotential height anomalies is assessed relative to MJO simulation skill and biases in the North Pacific jet zonal winds to determine reasons for possible poor teleconnections. Performance of the candidate model is assessed relative to a cloud of observations and CMIP5 simulations.
