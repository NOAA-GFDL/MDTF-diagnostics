### Data location settings ###
# Required: full path to ESM-intake catalog header file
DATA_CATALOG: "/local2/home/mdtf/MDTF-diagnostics/tools/catalog_builder/examples/gfdl/esm_catalog_DECK_ESM4_historical_D1_atmos_ts_monthly_5yr_subset.json"
# Optional: Parent directory containing observational data used by individual PODs.
# If defined, the framework assumes observational data is in OBS_DATA_ROOT/[POD_NAME]
OBS_DATA_ROOT: "../inputdata/obs_data"
# Required: Working directory location. Temporary files are written here.
# Final output is also written here if the OUTPUT_DIR is not defined.
WORK_DIR: "../wkdir"
# Optional: Location to write final output if you don't want it in the wkdir
OUTPUT_DIR: ""
### Environment Settings ###
# Required: Location of the Anaconda/miniconda installation to use for managing
# dependencies (path returned by running `conda info --base`.)
conda_root": ""
# Optional: Directory containing the framework-specific conda environments. This should
# be equal to the "--env_dir" flag passed to conda_env_setup.sh. If left
# blank, the framework will look for its environments in conda_root/envs
conda_env_root": ""
### Data type settings ###
# Type of data for the framework to process: `single_run` (default)
# for PODs that compare output from a single simulation to observational data
# for `multi_run` for PODs that analyze output from multiple simulations and/or
# observational datasets
data_type: "multi_run"
# Method used to fetch model data.
data_manager: "Local_File"
### Output Settings ###
# Set to true to have PODs save postscript figures in addition to bitmaps.
save_ps: False
# Set to true to have PODs save netCDF files of processed data.
save_nc: False
# Set to true to save HTML and bitmap plots in a .tar file.
make_variab_tar: False
# Set to true to overwrite results in OUTPUT_DIR; otherwise results saved
# under a unique name.
overwrite: False
### Developer settings ###
# Set to True to skip preprocessing
skip_preprocessor: False
