# Configuration file template for catalog_builder
# DRS convention to use cmip | gfdl | cesm
convention: cmip
# IMPORTANT: Attempting to build a catalog of the entire contents of a pp directory will likely max out available PPAN resources (i.e., it takes longer than 12 hours to build a catalog for atmos/ts/monthly/5yr one node w/16 threads). It is strongly recommended to use include_patterns and/or exclude_patterns to target a specific subset of variables and dates to improve the performance of the catalog builder.
# Path(s) to the root directory with the target dataset
data_root_dirs:
  - /uda/cmip6/CMIP/IPSL/IPSL-CM6A-LR-INCA/historical/r1i1p1f1
 # - /archive/oar.gfdl.cmip6/ESM4/DECK/ESM4_historical_D1/gfdl.ncrc4-intel16-prod-openmp/pp/atmos/ts/monthly/5yr

# depth to traverse for files from data_root_dir(s)
# (e.g., files that are in the root directory have dir_depth=1)
dir_depth: 5
# where to write catalog csv and json header files 
output_dir: /nbhome/[INSERT USERNAME HERE]
# name of catalog (.csv and .json will be appended to catalog and 
# header files)
output_filename: esm_catalog_IPSL-CM6A-LR-INCA_historica_r1i1p1f1
# number of threads: 16 (for job running on one analysis node)
# The example catalog for the UDA directory takes a little over 5 min to build
